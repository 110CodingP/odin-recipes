The Kheer appears creamy and is garnished with slivers of almonds and possibly other nuts. Additionally, there are dried flower petals scattered on top, adding a pop of color. The bowl is placed on a dark surface, and in the background, there’s another small bowl and more scattered petals. Overall, it’s a visually appealing representation of this classic South Asian dessert." height="390" width="390">
